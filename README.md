# todo-list-app

This is a to-do list app!
It was my first application made in React Native, and as a base I used the video tutorial from the YouTube channel 'Made With Matt' (https://www.youtube.com/@MadeWithMatt)

In this project I learned:
* Basic components of React Native
* How click and keyboard effects work
* How to use styled-components
* A bit of typescript
